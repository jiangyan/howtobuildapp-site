# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds interactive click and hover functionality to the "Case Studies" section in the hero component on the home page. Currently, the "Case Studies" section is static while the other two sections ("Practical Tutorials" and "AI Tools & Services") have interactive hover effects and click navigation. This enhancement will provide consistent user experience across all three hero feature highlights and redirect users to the blog page when they click on "Case Studies".

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to click on the "Case Studies" section in the hero area, so that I can navigate to the blog page to read case studies and related content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the "Case Studies" section THEN the system SHALL navigate to the `/blog` page
2. WHEN a user clicks anywhere within the "Case Studies" card area (icon, title, or description) THEN the system SHALL trigger the navigation
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL use Next.js Link component for proper client-side routing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want visual feedback when I hover over the "Case Studies" section, so that I understand it is clickable and consistent with the other interactive sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over the "Case Studies" section THEN the system SHALL change the background color of the icon container to match the hover pattern of other sections
2. WHEN a user hovers over the "Case Studies" section THEN the system SHALL change the title text color to indicate interactivity
3. WHEN a user hovers over the "Case Studies" section THEN the system SHALL apply smooth transition effects consistent with existing sections
4. WHEN a user stops hovering THEN the system SHALL return to the original styling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the "Case Studies" section to have the same visual and interaction patterns as the other hero sections, so that the interface feels consistent and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing all three hero sections THEN the system SHALL apply identical hover transition effects
2. WHEN comparing all three hero sections THEN the system SHALL use the same Link component structure
3. WHEN comparing all three hero sections THEN the system SHALL maintain the same cursor behavior (pointer on hover)
4. WHEN comparing styling THEN the system SHALL use consistent color schemes for hover states (green theme for Case Studies to match the existing icon)
